## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

Completed the implementation planning for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). Created a comprehensive plan.md with technical context, constitution check, and project structure. Generated research.md addressing technical unknowns, data-model.md defining key entities, quickstart.md with setup instructions, and updated agent context with Isaac-related technologies.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete implementation plan with research, data models, and quickstart guide
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for planning artifacts
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Task generation with /sp.tasks for implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully addressed all technical unknowns and created comprehensive planning artifacts

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
