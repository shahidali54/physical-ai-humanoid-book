## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) implementation. Created 42 specific tasks organized across 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and three user stories (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2) in priority order, plus polish phase. Tasks follow proper format with IDs, parallelization markers, user story labels, and specific file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown for implementation with 42 specific tasks
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for task generation
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive task list organized by phase
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation with /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully organized tasks by user story for independent implementation and testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
