# Plan Digital Twin Gazebo Unity Module

## User Input
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary
Completed the planning phase for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) including:

Phase 0 - Research & Analysis:
- Researched Gazebo physics simulation approaches
- Researched Unity visualization capabilities
- Determined sensor simulation strategy
- Selected documentation format

Phase 1 - Design & Contracts:
- Created data model for digital twin entities
- Developed quickstart guide for students
- Defined API contracts for simulation interfaces
- Updated agent context with new technologies (Gazebo, Unity, ROS 2)

Constitution Check:
- All constitution gates passed
- Technical accuracy maintained
- Docusaurus compatibility ensured
- Clear instructional writing preserved

Project Structure:
- Defined documentation structure in book/docs/02-digital-twin/
- Organized examples for Gazebo and Unity separately
- Planned diagrams and visual assets for student learning

## Outcome
Successfully completed the planning phase with all required artifacts created. The implementation plan is ready for task breakdown and execution.
