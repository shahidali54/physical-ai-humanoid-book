# Unity Visualization

## Introduction to Unity for Robotics

Unity is a powerful 3D development platform that provides high-fidelity visualization and interaction capabilities. When combined with physics simulation from Gazebo, Unity serves as the visual layer of digital twins, providing realistic rendering and intuitive interaction paradigms.

## Setting Up Unity for Robotics

Unity's flexible architecture allows for integration with robotics frameworks through various plugins and custom scripts. The key components for robotics visualization are:

### Scene Setup

A Unity scene for robotics typically includes:
- 3D models representing robots and environments
- Lighting setup for realistic rendering
- Camera systems for different viewpoints
- Physics materials for accurate visual interaction

### Humanoid Models

Humanoid models in Unity are special types of 3D characters that use a humanoid skeleton. This allows for:
- Natural movement animations
- Standardized control systems
- Compatibility with motion capture data

## Practical Example: Basic Humanoid Scene

Here's how to set up a basic humanoid scene in Unity:

```csharp
// Example Unity C# script for humanoid control
using UnityEngine;

public class HumanoidController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5.0f;
    public float rotateSpeed = 100.0f;

    void Update()
    {
        // Basic movement controls
        float translation = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        float rotation = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * rotateSpeed * Time.deltaTime;

        transform.Translate(0, 0, translation);
        transform.Rotate(0, rotation, 0);
    }
}
```

## Creating Interactive Experiences

Unity excels at creating interactive experiences for digital twins:
- Real-time camera control
- Intuitive UI for robot commands
- Visual feedback for sensor data
- Immersive environments for testing

## Integration with Simulation

Unity can be connected to physics simulations through:
- Custom networking protocols
- ROS integration packages
- Real-time data streaming
- Synchronized environment states
